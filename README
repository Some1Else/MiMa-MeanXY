Lets a MiddleMachine user explore their concepts and swiftly create entries

Current functionality

  Querying is possible by clicking tiles with fuzztle abbreviations (+, #, @, ..) or concept names in their labels
  Current query is displayed in the form of breadcrumbs below the tile UI
  Individual concepts can be excluded from the query by clicking on them in the breadcrumbs UI
  
- Backend
  Server params are configurable in javascripts/configuration.js
  Dimensions (pixels, numbers of rows and columns) can be configured in sass/style.sass (CSS preprocessing is done with Guardfile)
  
Future plans
